# Sheriff Plugin System - Implementation Progress

## 2026-01-12: plugin-types and plugin-api-types

### Completed
- Created `packages/core/src/lib/plugin/plugin.ts` with `SheriffPlugin` interface
- Created `packages/core/src/lib/plugin/plugin-api.ts` with:
  - `SheriffPluginAPI` interface
  - `VerificationResult` interface
  - `FileViolations` interface
  - `DependencyViolationInfo` interface
  - `ProjectDataOptions` interface

### Notes for Next Developer
- These two tasks were completed together because `SheriffPlugin` imports `SheriffPluginAPI`
- The types are now defined but NOT yet exported from the package index
- Next priority tasks (in order):
  1. `plugin-errors` - Add SH-013, SH-014, SH-015 error types to user-error.ts
  2. `config-types` - Add `plugins?: SheriffPlugin[]` to configuration types
  3. `plugin-resolver` - Create findPluginByName and validatePlugin functions
- The `plugin-api.ts` imports `Configuration` from config but doesn't expose it directly - plugins get it via `getConfig()` method
- Build passes (`nx run core:build`), all 347 tests pass

### Files Created
- `packages/core/src/lib/plugin/plugin.ts`
- `packages/core/src/lib/plugin/plugin-api.ts`

## 2026-01-12: plugin-errors

### Completed
- Added plugin-specific error types to `packages/core/src/lib/error/user-error.ts`:
  - Extended `UserErrorCode` type with `SH-013`, `SH-014`, `SH-015`
  - Created `PluginNotFoundError` (SH-013) - thrown when plugin name not found in plugins array
  - Created `PluginInvalidError` (SH-014) - thrown when plugin missing required name/execute properties
  - Created `PluginExecutionError` (SH-015) - wraps errors thrown during plugin execution

### Notes for Next Developer
- These error classes are ready to be used by the plugin-resolver and plugin-command implementations
- All errors have JSDoc comments explaining their purpose
- `PluginExecutionError` accepts either an Error object or a string for flexibility
- Next priority tasks (in order):
  1. `config-types` - Add `plugins?: SheriffPlugin[]` to configuration types
  2. `plugin-resolver` - Create findPluginByName and validatePlugin functions (will use these errors)
  3. `plugin-api-factory` - Create factory for SheriffPluginAPI
- Build passes (`npx nx run-many --target=build`), all 347 tests pass

### Files Modified
- `packages/core/src/lib/error/user-error.ts`
